Description:

A network port is identified by its number, the associated IP address, and the type of the
communication protocol such as TCP or UDP.
A listening port is a network port on which an application or process listens on, acting as
a communication endpoint.
Each listening port can be open or closed (filtered) using a firewall. In general terms, an
open port is a network port that accepts incoming packets from remote locations.

Rationale:

Services listening on the system pose a potential risk as an attack vector. These
services should be reviewed, and if not required, the service should be stopped, and the
package containing the service should be removed. If required packages have a
dependency, the service should be stopped and masked to reduce the attack surface of
the system.

Audit:

Run the following com

   lsof -i -P -n | grep -v "(ESTABLISHED)"

Review the output to ensure that all services listed are required on the system. If a listed
service is not required, remove the package containing the service. If the package
containing a non-essential service is required, stop and mask the non-essential service.

Remediation:

Run the following command to remove the package containing the service:

   apt purge <package_name>

OR If required packages have a dependency:
Run the following command to stop and mask the service:

   systemctl --now mask <service_name>
